# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* Version control is a way of tracking every change to a code, in order to make sure no mistakes are made.
* A branch is a separate path of code used to make additions to the master without initially changing the master.
* A commit is the same thing as saving your code. This is good practice to do on a regular basis.
* A merge conflict is when you try to merge new code into your current working files and something is incorrectly labeled or the new changes are incompatible.
