<!--
What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
  -A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.
What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
  -It uses a system called DOM which is a map of where things are displayed on a page according to the HTML.
What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
  -I actually use Atom so I had to look up snippets for Atom which I found very useful. Ideally I would like to take advantage of snippets as much as I can.
What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
  -Overall I found this challenge very easy, there were a few new tags I haven't used but a quick Google search solved that.
