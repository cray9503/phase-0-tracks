      1. The purpose of HTML5 semantic tags is to make the content more readable and accessible.
      2.The order the browser uses to diplay elements on a page 
      3. The rendering engine will parse through the HTML document and make it the tags into DOM nodes. The styling information will be used to create the render tree and the content goes in the content tree. The engine will then give the nodes the exact coordinates it should appear on the screen and then they will be painted. This all happens as soon as possible.
      4.I learned that you can create snippets in Sublime that allows for certain commands after writing somehting and pressing tab. I think I shall use this often for lay outs or code that is used often.
      5. I think the concept that was most difficult for me was the snippet. I did not get how each line of code worked. I shall have to research it more later on to fully utilize it.
